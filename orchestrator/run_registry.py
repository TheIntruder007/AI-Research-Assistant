"""In-memory registry for asynchronous pipeline runs, backing
GET /research/runs/{run_id} and its SSE event stream (orchestrator/api.py).

Deliberately in-memory and single-process: this is an MVP addition with no
job queue or persistence layer of its own — a run's live status is only
queryable from the same server process that started it, and is lost on
restart (though its artifacts on disk under outputs/ persist regardless,
same as any run started through the existing synchronous POST /research).
See DECISIONS.md D-017.
