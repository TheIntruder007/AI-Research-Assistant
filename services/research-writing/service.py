# triggers on an exception, so it never engages for an audit failure. With

# placeholder not matching cited_paper_ids) permanently failed a section
# with zero recovery attempts of any kind. A real stress-test run showed
# this as the dominant failure mode (4 of 5 sections failing on the exact
# same audit-detectable, already-correctable issue). One bounded revision
# round — using the already-tested audit-driven revise_section() path, only
# for sections that actually fail their first audit — is a small, targeted
