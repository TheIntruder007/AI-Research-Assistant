"""Deterministic allocation of a total paper-length target across the
outline's sections and the two "bookend" sections (Introduction/
Conclusion, generated separately — see DECISIONS.md D-025).

See DECISIONS.md D-025/D-026 for the full rationale. In short: the
previous architecture had a `target_words` field that was (a) never
actually reachable from any user interface, and (b) even when set, only
ever enforced as an upper bound on a naive equal split across sections —
never a real per-section target, minimum, or generation instruction. This
module is the fix: one real total-word target divided into per-role
budgets (with a target, a minimum, and a maximum), used both to guide
generation and to detect real under-generation.
