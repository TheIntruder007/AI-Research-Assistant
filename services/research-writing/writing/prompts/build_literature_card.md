Extract one evidence-rich literature card from one supplied Markdown paper for an
outline-driven review. Use only the current paper and supplied tag definitions.

### Evidence extraction

Respect the supplied `evidence_depth`. When it is `abstract`, the document is an abstract
evidence packet rather than a full paper: extract only claims explicitly stated in the
abstract, preserve abstract-level uncertainty, never infer unreported methods or results,
and never describe the source as having been reviewed in full text.

Extract claims that can support comparative review writing, not a generic paper summary.
Each point should express one citable proposition while retaining the methodological context,
studied population or system, comparison conditions, direction, uncertainty, and boundary
conditions needed to judge transferability. Split claims that differ in evidence type or
certainty; do not fragment away qualifiers that determine what the result means.

Classify empirical findings, methods, research questions, theoretical arguments, author
interpretations, stated limitations, background, and future directions accurately. Preserve
the paper's distinction between observation and explanation. Never convert correlation into
causation, a null result into proof of no effect, or author speculation into a finding.

### Provenance and tagging

1. Return every supplied tag ID exactly once; use `[]` when the paper is irrelevant.
2. Assign each point only to the deepest accurately matching tag. Do not duplicate a point in
   an ancestor. A genuinely cross-branch claim may reuse one point ID across those branches.
3. Never fill a tag by inference, outside knowledge, or a claim that appears only in the
   paper's reference list or its summary of prior work.
4. Use unique point IDs beginning with the supplied paper ID, for example
   `P003-POINT-01`.
5. Paraphrase faithfully in compact scientific prose. Do not quote text or cite page numbers.
6. Prefer supplied structured metadata; complete only genuinely missing fields that the
   current paper establishes. Produce paper-level citation information for this paper.

Before returning, verify that another writer could compare each point with other studies
without silently broadening its population, method, outcome, certainty, or scope.

### Output shape (do not confuse these two dictionaries)

`points` is keyed by POINT ID (each point's own `point_id`, e.g. `"P003-POINT-01"`).
`tag_values` is keyed by TAG ID (e.g. `"TAG-ROOT"`, `"TAG-1"`) and its values are lists of
point IDs that must already exist as keys in `points`. Never use a tag ID as a `points` key,
and never use a point ID as a `tag_values` key. Example shape for paper `P003` with tags
`TAG-ROOT` and `TAG-1`:

```json
{
  "points": {
    "P003-POINT-01": {"point_id": "P003-POINT-01", "content": "...", "content_type": "empirical_finding", "certainty": "supported"}
  },
  "tag_values": {
    "TAG-ROOT": [],
    "TAG-1": ["P003-POINT-01"]
  }
}
```
